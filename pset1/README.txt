1. Rectangle.java defines a rectangle class that provides a getLength method and a getWidth method and implements the Comparable class, comparing by perimeter. I have also added a getPerimeter method for use in problems 1 and 2. This file should be compiled with "javac Rectangle.java" and should be run with "java Rectangle".

2. Problem1.java creates a class called Problem1 that has the findMax routine provided in the problem. The file identifies the largest Rectangle and prints out its length and width. This file should be compiled with "javac Problem1" and should be run with "java Problem1"

3. Problem2.java creates a class called Problem2 that searches an array of rectangles recursively for a certain rectangle x. Because the Arrays.sort function only takes integers, not objects, I created an array of perimeters of the rectangles and created a map linking the perimeters to their corresponding original rectangles. I sorted the array of perimeters and created an array with the original rectangles sorted from smallest to largest. Then, the static method feeds this sorted array into the binarySearch method that searches the array recursively for rectangle x. This file should be compiled with "javac -Xlint:unchecked  Problem2.java" and run with "java Problem2"

4. Problem3.java implements the three code fragments from written problem 3 and records the runtime of each fragment on various input sizes. I used nanoTime() instead of currentTimeMillis() for more precision. I decided to run a different set of inputs for each fragment. The first fragment was an O(N) runtime, so I didn't have to worry so much about the runtime getting absurdly long or not being able to see a difference in runtimes due to the runtimes being too fast. The second fragment was going to be a quadratic runtime. I made sure the input sizes were smaller because I anticipated rapid growth in runtime. The third fragment was going to be a logarithmic runtime. I made the input sizes increase by very large amounts so that I could see a real difference in runtimes with different inputs. This file should be compiled with "javac Problem3.java" and run with "java Xint Problem3"
